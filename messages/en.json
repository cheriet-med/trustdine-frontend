  "text-1": "We're inspired by athletes. From the very first track spikes Adi Dassler made in his workshop, creating the best gear for the athlete is what drives us to pursue technological breakthroughs and design innovations. Our sneakers and apparel are worn by world-record holders and medal winners, but it's just as important that road runners, weekend hikers, recreational soccer players, and fitness enthusiasts. From adidas Boost, the game-changing cushioning technology, to the world-beating design of Adizero Adios Pro running shoes to Terrex outdoor gear to soccer cleats with unbeatable touch, we're always iterating, innovating and improving with athletes in mind.",
  "text-2": "The 3-Stripes have appeared on medal stands all around the world, but they've also had an influence that extends far beyond the field of play. adidas sneakers have been worn by hip-hop performers, skaters, artists and all the other change-makers who move the culture forward with their vision and uncompromising style. We've made our mark with legendary lifestyle shoes like the adidas Superstar, the Stan Smith and the Samba, shoes that began as athletic footwear before hitting the streets and leaving an indelible impression on the culture.",
  "text-3": "adidas Originals apparel is a stylish complement to our lifestyle shoes. Our streetwear collections pull from the archives to put a modern spin on classics like the Firebird tracksuit and the Tiro pant. Luxe materials, sophisticated silhouettes and unexpected details elevate our streetwear and transcend sport while at the same time never losing sight of our heritage. Because our mantra is, and has always been, that through sport we have the power to change lives."
